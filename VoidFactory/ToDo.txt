now gonna
clean up Shaders
reorganize namespaces
figure out how to implement complex Uniforms
	redo IData stuff to implement complex Uniforms
	and maybe try to somehow force them to declate ToBuffer
	maybe try to improve that so they demand a certain number of Bindings
then start trying to port this stuff to C++







FileParser:
	PolyHedra:
		split into multiple files
	Math:
		make number parser
		have default values ?
		instead of (1:0:2) use (1::2) or (1:_:2)
			for implicit default : leave segment empty
			for explicit default : use _
	SectionCheck:
		only check for Command headers
		each Command check other stuff itself
